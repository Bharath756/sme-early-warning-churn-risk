    "who are likely to churn in the near future (e.g., within the next 30–60 days),\n",
    "based on current behavior, tenure, pricing, and service engagement.\n",
    "\n",

    "'relative churn risk scoring' rather than exact churn timing."

    "that customers who churn exhibit detectable risk patterns prior to exit.\n",
